# VBA
VBA (Primarily for Excel)

<b>Full_USA.vba</b> is a VBA script I developed in order to parse import/export data derived from http://usatrade.census.gov.
The script is designed to handle both import/export data and output organized data and charts efficiently, for use in reports.

Note: The initial (current) version of code is much messier and uglier than I would prefer. This was an ad-hoc script thrown together in order to more rapidly produce charts of relevant data for use in reports. It performs the function as required, however I plan to clean up the code for future on-going use.
